# Financial Analyst Dashboard
**Overview**

This project is a Personal Financial Analyst tool designed to help manage and analyze personal financial data. By uploading previous years' bank statements, the system processes the data, categorizes expenses, and generates an interactive dashboard. The dashboard includes insightful visualizations such as monthly spending bar charts and daily expense distribution pie charts. Additionally, a chatbot powered by LLaMA is integrated to provide a conversational interface for financial insights and recommendations.
